Overview
--------------
BoxBoy is an ORM for .NET. 

The key idea is that you can work with data from different data stores in a homogenous fashion. In actual practice this library was only ever used as an ordinary ORM. There were aspirations for a more powerful tool that would allow data to move and be aggregated freely and easily between data stores.

History
--------------
An early prototype of this system was created in C++ in 1998/1999. It was subsequently recreated in Perl around 2000 (much easier!) and finally it was reimplemented for the last time in Java around 2001/2002, where it was intended to be a commercial product. Eventually I ported it to .NET (around 2002/2003) and used it in a few projects.
